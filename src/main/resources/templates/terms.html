            <li><strong>Customer</strong> — a person or business who requests or uses our courier services.</li>
            <li><strong>Services</strong> — courier, collection, delivery, warehousing, tracking, notifications and related services offered by Reliable Carriers.</li>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">3. Scope of Services</h2>
        <p>
            Reliable Carriers provides domestic parcel and courier services (national deliveries) as offered on our website and portal. Customers can register, request quotes, book shipments, pay online, and receive status notifications by email/SMS. Admin and driver dashboards allow internal users to manage, assign and update deliveries.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">4. Registration &amp; Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            To use certain Services you must register and create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">5. Booking, Pricing &amp; Payment</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Quotes:</strong> Quotes are calculated using the details you provide (weight, dimensions, pickup and delivery addresses, service speed). It is your duty to provide accurate information.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Orders must be paid online via the payment gateway integrated into our platform. An Order is only processed once payment has been received and confirmed by Reliable Carriers.</li>
            <li><strong>Errors:</strong> If you under-declare weight or dimensions, we reserve the right to adjust charges, collect outstanding amounts, or refuse carriage.</li>
            <li><strong>Refunds &amp; Cancellations:</strong> Cancellations are permitted only in accordance with our cancellation policy. Refunds (if any) are issued subject to service stage—no refund will be granted after dispatch except at our discretion.</li>
